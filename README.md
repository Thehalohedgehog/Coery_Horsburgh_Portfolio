# Coery_Horsburgh_Portfolio

A portfolio of work I've done on games either as course work, during my co-op terms or on my own time. Branches are organized by the different software/platforms I've used. The code and either executable files or links to playable versions are currently on this repostiory when possible. This repository is still a work in progress, more material will be added later (screenshots, demo videos, etc.) along with ideally more substantial work in the future as well.
